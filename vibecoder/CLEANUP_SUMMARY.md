# VibeCoder Project Cleanup Summary

## Files Moved to Backup

1. **Frontend**
   - Removed 6 redundant files:
     - `BUILD_FOR_HOSTINGER.bat`
     - `BUILD_FOR_RENDER.bat`
     - `BUILD_FOR_STATIC_HOSTING.bat`
     - `STATIC_BUILD.bat`
     - `next.config.static.js`
     - `app/page-new.tsx`
     - `test-frontend.md`
   - Removed build artifacts:
     - `.next/trace`

2. **Backend**
   - Removed 15 test scripts:
     - All `test-*.js` files
   - Removed test directory:
     - `src/test/` directory and all its subdirectories

## Files Kept

1. **Frontend**
   - Essential build scripts:
     - `BUILD_FOR_HOSTINGER_FIXED.bat`
     - `CREATE_STATIC_LANDING_PAGE.bat`
   - Configuration files:
     - `next.config.js`
     - `.vscode/settings.json`
   - Static files:
     - `hostinger_static/index.html`
     - `hostinger_static/.htaccess`

2. **Backend**
   - All production code
   - Deployment configuration:
     - `render.yaml`
     - `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Simplified Project Structure**
   - Removed duplicate build scripts that were causing confusion
   - Eliminated redundant configuration files
   - Organized remaining files logically

2. **Reduced Disk Space**
   - Removed unnecessary build artifacts and test files
   - All removed files are safely backed up in the `backup_redundant_files` directory

3. **Improved Development Experience**
   - Clear separation between production and development files
   - Simplified deployment process with fewer, better-documented scripts

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the backend to Render.com following the instructions in `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
2. Deploy the frontend to Hostinger using `BUILD_FOR_HOSTINGER_FIXED.bat` or `CREATE_STATIC_LANDING_PAGE.bat`
3. Configure API proxying as described in `SIMPLIFIED_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
4. Test the complete application

## File Backups

All removed files have been safely stored in the `backup_redundant_files` directory, preserving the original folder structure in case they are needed in the future.
