Upload all files from the `out/` folder to your Hostinger `public_html` directory.

### **üì§ Upload Methods:**

#### **Method 1: Hostinger File Manager (Recommended)**
1. **Login to Hostinger Panel:** https://hpanel.hostinger.com
2. **Go to:** File Manager
3. **Navigate to:** public_html
4. **Clear existing files** (backup first if needed)
5. **Upload all files** from the `out/` folder
6. **Extract if uploaded as ZIP**

#### **Method 2: FTP Upload**
1. **FTP Details:**
   - Host: vibecodeseller.com
   - Username: u238061207.vibecodeseller.com
   - Password: Vibeisgr8@
   - Port: 21
2. **Upload all files** from `out/` to `public_html/`

### **üîß Required .htaccess File**

Create this `.htaccess` file in your `public_html/` directory:

```apache
RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.html [L]

# Security Headers
